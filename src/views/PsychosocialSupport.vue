            Recognizing that many of our students come from challenging backgrounds, we understand that circumstances at home can greatly affect their mental well-being and academic performance.
            When we observe a drop in a student's performance, our dedicated liaison officers reach out to assess their situation, whether through phone calls or in-person meetings. This compassionate 
            approach helps us understand their needs better and determine the most appropriate steps to take, which may involve connecting them with professional counsellors, as we believe that a healthy 
            state of mind is essential for academic success. Our collaboration with Amani Counselling Centre, has been invaluable in providing the much-needed psychosocial support for our students, helping
            them navigate their challenges and thrive.
